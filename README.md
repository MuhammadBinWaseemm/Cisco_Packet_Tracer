# Packet-Tracer
This repository hosts the solutions for the Packet Tracer Assignment of the CY-211 Information Security course. It demonstrates network connectivity and communication using Cisco Packet Tracer through a series of tasks that build progressively complex network topologies, from a simple point-to-point connection to a multi-LAN network with routers.
