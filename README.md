# Packet-Tracer
This repository hosts the solutions for the Packet Tracer Assignment of the CY-211 Information Security course. It demonstrates network connectivity and communication using Cisco Packet Tracer through a series of tasks that build progressively complex network topologies, from a simple point-to-point connection to a multi-LAN network with routers.

# Overview

Course: CY-211 - Information Security

Instructor: Dr. M. Zain Siddiqi

# Tasks Summary

Task 1: Connected two PCs in a point-to-point topology using a Copper Cross-Over Ethernet cable.

Task 2: Extended Task 1 by adding a switch to form a star topology LAN, connecting PCs via Copper Straight-Through cables.

Task 3: Connected two LANs (each with two PCs and a switch) through a router using a point-to-point WAN link.

Task 4: Extended Task 3 by adding dedicated routers for each LAN, connected to a main router via crossover cables, forming a network of two star LANs linked through a central router.

# How to Use

Install Cisco Packet Tracer.

Replicate the topologies as described in the assignment.

Configure devices as specified in the submission PDF.

Use Packet Tracer's simulation mode to verify communication.
